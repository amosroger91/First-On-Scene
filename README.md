</div>

## üö® The Triage Agent's Mission

**First-On-Scene** acts as a **First Responding Officer** to cybersecurity incidents. When your antivirus, EDR, or network monitors trigger an alert, this toolkit performs automated forensic triage to determine if a real threat exists‚Äîseparating actual incidents from false positives with AI-powered analysis.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Run one command. Get instant AI-powered triage.**

### Prerequisites
1. **Administrator PowerShell** - Required for forensic data collection
2. **OpenRouter API Key** (FREE) - Get yours at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
   - No credit card required
   - Takes 2 minutes to set up
   - You'll be prompted on first run

### Local Execution

**One-liner (download and run):**
```powershell
$d=(Join-Path $env:TEMP "FOS_Run"); New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $d -Force | Out-Null; iwr "https://github.com/amosroger91/First-On-Scene/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -OutFile "$d\m.zip" -UseBasicParsing; Expand-Archive -Path "$d\m.zip" -DestinationPath $d -Force; & "$d\First-On-Scene-main\scripts\Gather_Info.ps1"
```

**From cloned repository:**
```powershell
.\scripts\Gather_Info.ps1
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. ‚úÖ Collects forensic artifacts (processes, registry, network, event logs)
2. ‚úÖ Parses and analyzes the data
3. ‚úÖ Launches AI triage using Qwen3 Coder 480B (via OpenRouter)
4. ‚úÖ Generates detailed findings report
5. ‚úÖ Makes final call: **Problem Detected** or **All Clear**

### Remote Execution

Analyze a remote machine (requires WinRM enabled):

```powershell
.\scripts\Gather_Info.ps1 -ComputerName "RemotePC" -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

**Enable WinRM on target machine:**
```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
```

| Google Gemini | ‚úÖ Good | ‚ùå **Paid API** (after trial) | ‚ùå Not viable |
| OpenAI GPT | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚ùå **Expensive** | ‚ùå Not viable |
| Claude API | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚ùå **Paid** | ‚ùå Not viable |

### What is OpenRouter?

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) is an API gateway providing **unified access to dozens of AI models**. Their free tier includes:
- **Qwen3 Coder 480B A35B** (what we use) - Massive model specialized for code and technical analysis
- Qwen 2.5 72B Instruct - Larger general-purpose model
- Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B Instruct - Alternative coder model

### Setup (One-Time, 2 Minutes)

1. **Create free account**: Visit [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. **Generate API key**: Click "Create Key" (no credit card)
3. **Run First-On-Scene**: You'll be prompted for the key on first run
4. **Done**: Key is securely stored in Windows Credential Manager for future runs

**Yes, it's an extra step.** But it means:
- ‚úÖ State-of-the-art AI analysis for $0
- ‚úÖ No monthly subscriptions or usage limits (within free tier)
- ‚úÖ A tool that works long-term without asking for payment

We chose this path to ensure **First-On-Scene remains truly free and accessible** to MSPs, IT professionals, and security teams of all sizes.

## üîç The Triage Agent's Approach

A Responding Officer arriving at a crime scene must secure the area and, without contaminating evidence, quickly determine what happened. Our approach directly parallels this:

| Responding Officer Duty | Triage Agent Duty |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Determine if a "crime" occurred** | **Determine if a malicious event definitively occurred** by separating threats from false positives |
| **Determine if "crime" is ongoing** | **Determine if attack is ongoing/uncontained**, checking active processes, network connections, persistence |
| **Document without tampering** | **Document every action** to preserve integrity. All commands logged to `Steps_Taken.txt` |
| **Interview witnesses** | **Gather info from client** about what they observed or actions taken |
| **Check cameras and logs** | **Execute data collection and parsing** to systematically review logs and forensic data |
| **Determine escalation** | **Make final decisive call** based on classification (Event, Incident, or Breach) |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works: The Agentic Triage Strategy

**First-On-Scene** operates on a **Structured LLM Triage** strategy, treating the AI as a scoring engine for pre-defined forensic indicators.

### Forensic Analysis Categories

The AI analyzes four key categories:

| Category | What It Checks | AI Task |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | Registry Run keys | Identify non-standard startup entries |
| **Execution** | Running processes | Flag processes from user profiles/temp dirs |
| **Network** | Active connections | Find unusual external connections |
| **Credential Access** | Security event logs | Detect suspicious logon patterns (Event IDs 4624/4672) |

### Forensic Artifacts Collected

**Currently Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ **Running Processes** - All active processes with paths and command lines
- ‚úÖ **Network Connections** - TCP connections with owning processes
- ‚úÖ **Registry Run Keys** - Persistence mechanisms (HKCU/HKLM)
- ‚úÖ **Security Event Logs** - Logon events (4624/4672)
- ‚úÖ **Antivirus Scans** - ClamAV and Windows Defender results

**Planned for Future:**
- Full memory (RAM) image
- Full disk image
- Prefetch files, Jump Lists, LNK files
- Browser history and downloads
- USB device history
- Credential Manager data

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Output & Decision Making

### Final Action

The AI must make a decisive call:

- **`scripts/Problem_Detected.ps1 [REASON_CODE]`** - Called if classification is a **Breach** or uncontained **Incident**
  - Argument must be capitalized, concise (e.g., "MALWARE_DETECTED")
  - Displays critical alert and logs to `results/Steps_Taken.txt`

- **`scripts/All_Clear.ps1`** - Called if classification is a contained **Event** or False Positive
  - Logs clearance action

### Output Files

All analysis results are saved to the `results/` directory:

- **`findings.txt`** - MANDATORY: Structured Markdown report explaining analysis and findings
- **`Steps_Taken.txt`** - MANDATORY: Append-only audit log of all actions
- **`Info_Results.txt`** - Structured JSON with parsed triage indicators
- Raw forensic data (JSON files)

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Automated Workflow

When you run `.\scripts\Gather_Info.ps1`, here's what happens:

1. **Data Collection** - `Gather_Info.ps1` collects forensic artifacts
2. **Parsing** - `Parse_Results.ps1` runs automatically, structures data into `Info_Results.txt`
3. **AI Analysis** - Qwen CLI launches with OpenRouter, analyzes findings
4. **Report Generation** - AI writes detailed analysis to `findings.txt`
5. **Final Decision** - AI executes either `Problem_Detected.ps1` or `All_Clear.ps1`

**Everything is logged to `results/Steps_Taken.txt` for audit trail.**

---

## üîí PowerShell Remoting Prerequisites

For remote execution, PowerShell Remoting must be enabled on target machine(s).

**On the target machine** (run as Administrator):
```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
```

**Firewall requirements:**
- Allow WinRM traffic (port 5985 for HTTP, 5986 for HTTPS)

---

## üìä Cybersecurity Classification Framework

The AI uses these definitions to classify findings:

- **Breach of Confidentiality** - Unauthorized access/disclosure of confidential information
- **Malware** - Intentionally harmful software inserted in system
- **Ransomware** - Malicious attack encrypting organization data, demanding payment
- **Unauthorized Access** - Logical/physical access without permission
- **Phishing** - Fraudulent attempt to acquire sensitive data
- **Spyware** - Software secretly gathering information
- **Virus** - Self-replicating program infecting system

(See `system_prompt.txt` for complete classification definitions)
