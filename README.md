## üöÄ Quick Start

**Run one PowerShell command. Get instant AI-powered triage.**

### Prerequisites

1. **Windows with PowerShell** - This toolkit is currently **Windows-only** (PowerShell). Linux/Bash support is planned for future releases.
2. **Administrator Privileges** - Required for forensic data collection.
3. **OpenRouter API Key** (FREE) - Get yours at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
   - No credit card required
   - Takes 2 minutes to set up
   - You'll be prompted on first run
   - Securely stored in Windows Credential Manager
4. **Winget (Optional)** - Recommended for automatic installation of Git, Node.js, and ClamAV.

### Run It (PowerShell One-Liner)

**Download and run from GitHub (PowerShell as Administrator):**
```powershell
$d=(Join-Path $env:TEMP "FOS_Run"); New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $d -Force | Out-Null; iwr "https://github.com/amosroger91/First-On-Scene/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" -OutFile "$d\m.zip" -UseBasicParsing; Expand-Archive -Path "$d\m.zip" -DestinationPath $d -Force; & "$d\First-On-Scene-main\scripts\Gather_Info.ps1"
```

**Or clone and run locally:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/amosroger91/First-On-Scene.git
cd First-On-Scene
.\scripts\Gather_Info.ps1
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. ‚úÖ Collects volatile forensic artifacts (network connections, processes, open files)
2. ‚úÖ Collects persistent forensic artifacts (registry, scheduled tasks, services, event logs)
3. ‚úÖ Parses and structures the data
4. ‚úÖ Launches AI triage using OpenRouter's free tier
5. ‚úÖ Generates detailed findings report (`results/findings.txt`)
6. ‚úÖ Makes final decision: **Problem Detected** or **All Clear**
7. ‚úÖ Executes custom action scripts for automation (optional)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Evidence Integrity Mode (Default):**
- Rkill execution **SKIPPED** (preserves volatile evidence)
- Defender auto-enable **SKIPPED** (preserves stealth)
- Use `-RunRkill` and `-EnableDefender` flags to enable these (modifies system state)

## üåê Remote vs. Local Execution

**First-On-Scene can analyze both local and remote Windows systems.**

### Local Execution
Run on the **suspected compromised computer itself**:
```powershell
.\scripts\Gather_Info.ps1
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Risk:** If the system is compromised, malware could interfere with data collection or tamper with results.

### Remote Execution (Recommended)
Run from a **clean computer on the same network** to analyze a remote target:
```powershell
.\scripts\Gather_Info.ps1 -ComputerName "SuspectPC" -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

**Why remote execution is better:**
- ‚úÖ **Avoids contamination**: Malware on the target can't interfere with your analysis tools
- ‚úÖ **Safer**: Your analysis machine remains clean
- ‚úÖ **Better evidence integrity**: Collection happens from a trusted source
- ‚úÖ **Stealth**: Some advanced malware can detect and evade local forensic tools

**Requirements for remote execution:**
- PowerShell Remoting (WinRM) must be enabled on the target computer
- Network connectivity between your analysis machine and the target
- Administrative credentials for the target computer

**Enable WinRM on target computer (run as Administrator):**
```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
```

**Ports:**
- WinRM uses port 5985 (HTTP) or 5986 (HTTPS)
- Ensure these ports are open on the target's firewall

**WinRM Auto-Fix:**
First-On-Scene includes automatic WinRM corruption detection and repair. If WinRM is corrupted, the script will attempt to restore it remotely before falling back to local execution.

---

## ü§ñ Custom Actions & Automation

**First-On-Scene doesn't just analyze‚Äîit acts.**

After the AI makes its final determination, it executes one of two PowerShell scripts that you can customize for your environment:

1. **`scripts/Problem_Detected.ps1`** - Executed when a threat is confirmed
   - Receives a `REASON_CODE` argument (e.g., "MALWARE_DETECTED", "RANSOMWARE_ENCRYPTED_FILES")
   - **Default:** Shows a critical alert message box
   - **Customize:** Send alerts, create tickets, isolate systems, trigger workflows

2. **`scripts/All_Clear.ps1`** - Executed when no threat is found
   - **Default:** Shows an "all clear" message box
   - **Customize:** Close tickets, update dashboards, send notifications

### Customization Examples

Both scripts are **templates** with extensive inline documentation. Here are some integration examples:

**Trigger an n8n Workflow:**
```powershell
# Add to Problem_Detected.ps1
$webhookUrl = "https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/incident-alert"
$body = @{
    incident = "First-On-Scene Detection"
    reason = $REASON_CODE
    hostname = $env:COMPUTERNAME
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $webhookUrl -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Create a ServiceNow Ticket:**
```powershell
$ticketData = @{
    summary = "Security Alert: $REASON_CODE"
    description = "First-On-Scene detected a security incident on $($env:COMPUTERNAME)"
    priority = 1
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-instance.service-now.com/api/now/table/incident" `
    -Method Post -Body $ticketData -Headers @{Authorization="Basic YOUR_API_KEY"}
```

**Send Slack Alert:**
```powershell
$slackWebhook = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
$slackMessage = @{
    text = ":rotating_light: *CRITICAL INCIDENT DETECTED* :rotating_light:"
    attachments = @(@{
        color = "danger"
        fields = @(
            @{ title = "Reason"; value = $REASON_CODE; short = $true }
            @{ title = "Hostname"; value = $env:COMPUTERNAME; short = $true }
        )
    })
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $slackWebhook -Method Post -Body $slackMessage -ContentType "application/json"
```

### Advanced: Custom Action Script Paths

You can specify custom scripts via command-line parameters:

```powershell
.\scripts\Gather_Info.ps1 `
    -CustomProblemScript "C:\MyScripts\SendAlert.ps1" `
    -CustomAllClearScript "C:\MyScripts\ClearAlert.ps1" `
    -BrandName "Acme Security" `
    -LogoPath "C:\MyLogo.png"
```

**Security Note:** These scripts run with the same permissions as the user executing `Gather_Info.ps1`. Be cautious when adding commands, especially with administrative privileges.

## üîç How It Works: The Triage Process

**First-On-Scene** parallels how a responding officer handles a crime scene:

| Responding Officer | First-On-Scene |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Determine if a crime occurred** | **Determine if a malicious event occurred** by separating threats from false positives |
| **Check if crime is ongoing** | **Determine if attack is active/uncontained** by checking processes, network, persistence |
| **Document without tampering** | **Log every action** to `results/Steps_Taken.txt` (append-only audit trail) |
| **Interview witnesses** | **Gather info from the user** about observed behaviors |
| **Check cameras and logs** | **Execute data collection** to review logs and forensic data |
| **Determine escalation** | **Make final decisive call** based on classification (Event, Incident, or Breach) |

### Forensic Analysis Categories

The AI analyzes data across multiple categories:

| Category | What It Checks | What It Looks For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | Registry Run keys, Scheduled Tasks, Windows Services, WMI Event Subscriptions | Non-standard startup entries, hidden tasks, suspicious services, WMI-based persistence |
| **Execution** | Running processes, Process Creation Events (Event ID 4688) | Processes from user profiles/temp dirs, suspicious parent-child relationships, obfuscated commands |
| **Network** | Active TCP connections | Unusual external connections on high-risk ports (80, 443, 8080, 4444, 5555, 8443, 3389) |
| **Credential Access** | Security event logs (Logons, Service Installs, User Creations, Object Access) | Suspicious logon patterns, service installations, user account creations (Event IDs 4624, 4672, 4697, 4720, 4663) |
| **PowerShell Activity** | PowerShell Operational Logs | Obfuscated commands, base64 encoding, suspicious cmdlets (`Invoke-Expression`, `DownloadString`, etc.) |
| **File System** | MACE Timestamps | Timestomping indicators (creation time after modification time) |
| **Antivirus Scans** | Windows Defender, ClamAV, Rkill | Malware detections, terminated malicious processes |
| **Browser Activity** | Browser history databases (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) | Collected for manual analysis (requires SQLite parsing) |

### Forensic Artifacts Collected

**Currently Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Network TCP Connections (with owning processes) - **Volatile**
- ‚úÖ Running Processes (with paths, command lines, parent-child relationships) - **Volatile**
- ‚úÖ Open Files and Handles (open files, SMB sessions, mapped drives) - **Volatile** ‚≠ê NEW
- ‚úÖ Registry Run/RunOnce keys (HKCU/HKLM) - **Volatile**
- ‚úÖ Scheduled Tasks (all tasks with paths, authors, states, arguments) - **Persistent**
- ‚úÖ Windows Services (configuration, start modes, executable paths) - **Persistent**
- ‚úÖ WMI Event Subscriptions (Event Filters, Consumers, Bindings) - **Persistent**
- ‚úÖ Security Event Logs (Logon, Admin, Process Creation, Service Install, User Creation, Object Access) - **Persistent**
- ‚úÖ PowerShell Operational Logs (Script Block Logging) - **Persistent**
- ‚úÖ Browser History Databases (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) - **Persistent**
- ‚úÖ MACE Timestamps (Modified, Accessed, Created, Entry metadata) - **Persistent**
- ‚úÖ Antivirus Scans (Optional - use `-RunRkill` and `-EnableDefender` flags):
  - ClamAV full system scan (if available)
  - Windows Defender full scan (only if running OR if `-EnableDefender` flag used)
  - Rkill execution (ONLY if `-RunRkill` flag used - modifies system state!)

**Planned for Future:**
- Full memory (RAM) image
- Full disk image
- Prefetch files, Jump Lists, LNK files
- USB device history
- Credential Manager data
- Group Policy snapshots

## ‚öôÔ∏è Output & Reports

All analysis results are saved to the `results/` directory:

### Generated Files

- **`findings.txt`** - MANDATORY: Structured Markdown report with AI's complete analysis and findings
- **`Incident_Report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html`** - Professional, human-readable HTML report
- **`Incident_Report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.docx`** - Professional DOCX report (if Word conversion succeeds)
- **`Info_Results.txt`** - Structured JSON with parsed triage indicators (output from `Parse_Results.ps1`)
- **`Steps_Taken.txt`** - MANDATORY: Append-only audit log of all actions taken
- **`config.json`** - Configuration file (target computer, branding, custom script paths)
- **Raw forensic data** (various JSON files):
  - `registry_run_keys.json`
  - `scheduled_tasks.json`
  - `services_config.json`
  - `wmi_persistence.json`
  - `processes_snapshot.json`
  - `netstat_snapshot.json`
  - `security_events.json`
  - `powershell_logs.json`
  - `file_metadata.json`
  - `browser_artifacts.json`
  - `defender_scan_results.txt`
  - `clamav_scan_results.txt`
  - `rkill_execution.log`

### Final Action Decision

The AI must make a decisive call:

- **`scripts/Problem_Detected.ps1 [REASON_CODE]`** - Called if classification is a **Breach** or uncontained **Incident**
  - Argument must be capitalized, concise (e.g., "MALWARE_DETECTED", "RANSOMWARE_ENCRYPTED_FILES", "UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS")
  - Displays a critical alert and logs to `results/Steps_Taken.txt`

- **`scripts/All_Clear.ps1`** - Called if classification is a contained **Event** or **False Positive**
  - Logs the clearance action to `results/Steps_Taken.txt`

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Automated Workflow

When you run `.\scripts\Gather_Info.ps1`, here's the complete workflow:

1. **Parameter Validation** - Processes command-line arguments (target computer, credentials, custom scripts, branding)
2. **WinRM Check & Auto-Fix** (Remote only) - Tests PSRemoting and attempts self-healing if WinRM corruption is detected
3. **Software Dependency Check** (Local only) - Uses Winget to ensure Git, Node.js, and ClamAV are installed
4. **Pre-Scan Remediation** - Downloads and executes `rkill.exe` to neutralize active malware
5. **Data Collection** - `Gather_Info.ps1` collects comprehensive forensic artifacts (local or remote)
6. **Parsing** - `Parse_Results.ps1` automatically structures data into `results/Info_Results.txt`
7. **API Token Validation** - Retrieves or prompts for OpenRouter API key (stored in Windows Credential Manager)
8. **AI Analysis** - The LLM (via OpenRouter/qwen CLI) analyzes `Info_Results.txt` and raw forensic data
9. **LLM Error Diagnostics** - If script errors occur, the LLM provides diagnostic assistance
10. **Report Generation** - AI writes `findings.txt`, and `Generate_Report.ps1` creates HTML/DOCX reports
11. **Final Decision & Action** - AI executes either `Problem_Detected.ps1` or `All_Clear.ps1`

**Everything is logged to `results/Steps_Taken.txt` for a complete audit trail.**

## üìä Cybersecurity Classification Framework

The AI uses these definitions to classify findings:

- **Breach of Confidentiality** - Unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of confidential information
- **Brute Force Attack** - Attempting multiple password combinations to gain access
- **Business Email Compromise** - Sophisticated scam targeting legitimate fund transfers
- **Fraudulent Transaction** - Unauthorized use of accounts/payment info resulting in loss
- **Loss or Theft of Equipment** - Removal of physical assets without consent
- **Malware** - Intentionally harmful software, firmware, or hardware
- **Phishing** - Fraudulent solicitation masquerading as legitimate to acquire sensitive data
- **Ransomware** - Malicious attack encrypting data and demanding payment
- **Spam** - Unsolicited bulk messages via electronic messaging
- **Spyware** - Software secretly gathering information without knowledge
- **Unauthorized Access** - Gaining logical/physical access without permission
- **Virus** - Self-replicating program that corrupts/deletes data without permission
- **Vulnerability** - Weakness in systems/procedures that could be exploited

(See `system_prompt.txt` for complete classification definitions with citations)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Platform Support & Future Plans

**Current Status: Windows Only (PowerShell)**

First-On-Scene is currently designed for **Windows systems** and requires **PowerShell 5.1+**.

**Why Windows-only right now?**
- Native PowerShell Remoting (WinRM) support
- Windows-specific forensic artifacts (Registry, Windows services, Event Logs, etc.)
- Windows Defender and ClamAV integration
- Windows Credential Manager for secure token storage

**Future Plans:**
We are **considering expanding to Linux (Bash)** in future releases. Linux support would include:
- Bash equivalents of the action scripts (`problem_found.sh`, `no_problem.sh`)
- Linux-specific forensic artifact collection (systemd services, cron jobs, auth logs, etc.)
- SSH-based remote execution instead of WinRM
- Secure token storage via Linux keyring

**Stay tuned** - We'll update this README when Linux support is added.
